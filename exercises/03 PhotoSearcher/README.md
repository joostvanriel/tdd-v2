# Photo Searcher #
The goal of this exercise is to learn about isolating your subject under test by stubbing and/or mocking. The class that needs testing in this example is PhotoDeleter.

PhotoDeleter depends on a PhotoRepository, which, in a production environment, could be a database.

Try to implement, in a test-driven way, the DeletePhotos methods. Start with the easy one first. If you have time left, move on to the second one.
